Babel + Electron + React + Browserify + Sass application stack. Gets the stupid work done so you can actually make something.

## What stupid work, exactly?

- Build your app with one command.
- Open a live-reloading instance of your app with another command.
- Lint your app using a third command.

## How to get started

The specialized `git clone` command and following `rm -rf .git` ensure that the git history of jolteon is not replicated so that you can enter your new jolteon project and `git init` a new project with new remotes, new history, etc. `gulp-cli` is required to run gulp and `electron` is installed to be able to test your project locally without `gulp package` every time (via `gulp serve`).

You may also want to `rm -rf` this README.md after you're all set up and replace it with the README for your project.

```
npm install -g gulp-cli electron
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/vulpino/jolteon my-jolteon-project
cd my-jolteon-project
rm -rf .git
npm install
gulp serve
```

## Directory Structure

- Your client HTML lives in app/.
- Your client javascript lives in app/js/.
- Your client SCSS lives in app/scss.
- Your react components live in app/js/components/.
- Your electron server code lives in src/.
- Everything is programmed using Javascript, ES2015 as the default.

### Building

- Build the client and server bundles: `gulp build`
- Watch app/ and src/ for changes and update build/ automagically: `gulp watch`
- Lint everything (We use StandardJS, but you can modify the .eslintrc.json): `gulp lint`
- Open up the app: `gulp serve`. This will also live reload everything, so don't worry about that.
- Package the app for release: `gulp package`.
